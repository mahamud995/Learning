MULTIPLE BROKERS AND TOPIC WITH REPLICATION

create a topic with replication factor 3 .  It is suggested to don’t go replication factor beyond 3.

bin/windows/kafka-topics.bat  --bootstrap-server localhost:9092,localhost:9093,localhost:9094  --create --replication-factor 3 --partitions 5 --topic months  (partitions are spread across three brokers)

We have  partitions => 5 and replication factor => 3  . So totally (5*3 = 15 ) partitions are created in the cluster.


We have 3 brokers in the cluster . So each broker will have 5 partitions . You can also check the log folder of kafka broker . You can see each log folder has 5 partitions.

Now we should see same partitions in different brokers. Due to replication factor = 3 . If there are replicas  then one of the broker is leader for a specific partition and all the remaining brokers are followers . They simply accept write request from the leaders and they don’t sell producers and consumers for particular partition where they are not leaders.

Only Leader broker in the partition serves producers and consumers.  And all the remaining borkers are just followers they simply synchronize messages with leader.
